                    <br>
                    <p>I am a developer from Brazil, finishing my computer science degree at the University of Montana and working currently at Spectral Fusion Designs. I dedicate myself to give all my projects a modern feel, responsive develoment and functional qualities.</p>
                    <p>Through social media and news feed I keep an eye out for new and trending technologies, handy plugins, new frameworks, and programming languages. In the past year I have learned Java, Python. By the spring I hope to be proficient on Database Structure and C and C++ and other topics I might encounter throughout my classes this school year.</p>
                    <p>This past summer has been a busy one for me. With my new job at as programmer I have had to learn Unix Command Line, PHP and its framework Laravel, MySQL and ultimately Drupal and Cascade content management systems, within two months. It has been great to take on a fresh challenge to learn at an accelerating development environment and craft convenient tools for our clients.</p>
                    <p>I enjoy developing web applications that are elegant, completely functional and offer the finest user experience possible using HTML, CSS, jQuery and PHP resources. I emphasize on fully responsive development therefore you can have your application be seen in any device.</p>
